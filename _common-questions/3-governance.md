# Governance

## Is it mandatory to use APEX?

Apex will be mandated in future.

Apex is not meant for National Emergency Critical applications. The planned SLA for Apex in production is 99.5%.

---

## What security measures are in place to access the Apex self-service portal?

---

## Will the Apex team be providing any audit support to the agencies?

The Apex Team will be providing documentation for audit on the infrastructure level. As for the application level, agencies need to manage their own audit documentation.

---

## Can I expose an API only to a particular agency and not expose to the Apex API catalog that everyone can view?

Yes. You can create a “private” API and invite specific users to consume your API. In this case, the API will not appear in the API catalogue.

---

## What is the process for businesses and banks to consume an API?

Non-governmental entities will not have direct access to the Apex portal. The API Provider needs to provide the API endpoint directly to external business. Once the required firewalls are opened, the non-governmental entity can directly hit the endpoint.
