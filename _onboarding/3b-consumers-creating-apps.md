# Manage an App

An App is a logical collecting of APIs. It facilitates management for consumers with a single identity when APIs are invoked and allows the setting of security parameters for L1 (Username and Password) and L2 (Public Certificate Upload) security.

For GWSX Consumers, to migrate your L1 credential, you can define **App ID (Username)** and **Shared Secret (Password)** to the existing credential in GWSX. You can still edit them later if needed.

For other Consumers, filled up the mandatory fields marked with a \*.

Click **Finish** to proceed, and you will be redirected to the App Page.
