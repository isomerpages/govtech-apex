# Benefits of using APEX

## Robust Governance and Monitoring

APEX is a centralized point to manage, monitor and secure your APIs. The platform also provides real-time API monitoring and logging for auditing purposes. fhgfhhjghhg

## Easy and Sustainable Data Sharing

The automated workflow reduces the efforts required for both the Provider and the Consumer, thus encouraging the creation of innovative digital services that will be published through an API catalogue.

## Security

APEX supports APP ID and Secret (User Authentication), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Signing and OAuth for API security. The platform is also designed to be compliant with government’s security policies.

## Oversight and Control

APEX is a self-service portal. The APIs are governed and maintained by the API Provider agencies.

## Faster Delivery of Service

With the API catalogue, agencies can discover and reuse existing APIs to integrate with their existing technology stack. This reduces an agency’s development, integration and troubleshooting time, thereby speeding up service delivery.

## Cost Saving

Having a centralized and shared platform enables new projects to leverage on the infrastructure and operation cost.
