All express or implied rights to the Services not specifically granted herein are expressly reserved to GovTech.
    2. GovTech grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Services for internal use only.
    3. You may not, unless permitted by GovTech or the respective owners, directly or indirectly, alone or with any third party, or authorize or permit any third party to:
        1. bypass or circumvent any technical restrictions or digital protection measures in the Services or attempt to circumvent any restrictions;
        2. reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, adapt or create derivative works of the Services (whether in relation to its source code, object code, underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms or otherwise);
        3. reproduce, publish, distribute, transfer, publicly display, resell, rent, lease, sublicense, loan, lend, pledge, assign, or otherwise encumber the Services to or in favour of any third party;
        4. remove or obscure the copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices contained on or in the Services;
        5. use the Services in any manner that is contrary to any applicable laws or regulations or agreements that you have with any third party;
        6. use the Services commercially, or for commercial software or commercial audit services, or make the Software available in a service bureau or any similar timesharing arrangement;
        7. perform any benchmarking tests or analysis of the Services;
        8. use the Services to create anything that would compete with the Services;
        9. use the Services for the benefit of any third party (unless the Services are intended to benefit such third parties);
        10. transfer, assign or permit the sharing of license keys to a third party;
        11. use the Services to process or permit to be processed any code of a third party; or
        12. otherwise provide third party access to the Services.
    4. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any authentication credentials associated with your use of the Services. You must promptly notify GovTech about any possible misuse of your accounts or authentication credentials or any security incident related to the Services.
4. Term and Termination
    1. GovTech will provide the Services for the period you are authorized by an Authorizing Agency to access or use the Services, or until earlier termination in accordance with these Usage Terms.
    2. GovTech may terminate these Usage Terms without cause (and without liability) immediately without notice.
5. Third Party Materials
    1. The Services may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of other software or services of a third party (“Third Party”). In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party software or service (the “Third Party Terms”). GovTech may be required under or as a result of the Third Party Terms to notify you of certain terms that apply to you (whether directly as an end user, or as a party whose acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms, or to inform you of any restrictions concerning the Services where the provision of the same is dependent on the Third Party Provider) when you use the Services. For example, the Third Party Provider may require you to give it certain access rights to any content you upload to the Services. If these Usage Terms do not already account for the Third Party Terms, then information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Services, publicly available, or otherwise listed in the Third Party Schedule annexed herein. Third Party Terms of open source software will be embedded in the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Third Party Terms refer to the terms of yet another third party, then those terms are also Third Party Terms.
    2. It is your responsibility to check and read the most up-to-date versions of these Third Party Terms and you are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms. In particular, you are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms that GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you unconditionally agree to be bound by all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are applicable to you as the end user.
    3. If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly with the Third Party, then you unconditionally agree to enter into such agreement, and in any event, to be legally bound by the Third Party Terms. By accepting this Usage Terms, and having notice of these Third Party Terms as set out in Clause 5.1 above, you are deemed to have entered into such Third Party agreements and those agreements will govern your use of the relevant third party software or service, and not these Usage Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit either a direct licence to you from the Third Party or a sublicence from GovTech to you. In such cases, your licence is a direct licence from the Third Party to you.
    4. If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to incorporate certain terms in the Usage Terms (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum standards herein), such terms are deemed to have been so incorporated (the “Incorporated Terms”). Examples of Incorporated Terms include provisions which require GovTech to give you notice of certain rights and liabilities, require GovTech to ensure that you acknowledge certain matters. Similarly, if the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require these Usage Terms to be altered such that the Third Party Terms are complied with, the parties herein agree that the Usage Terms shall be deemed to be so altered but only to the extent necessary for compliance.
    5. Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to grant the Third Party, direct rights of enforcement of the Usage Terms as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third Party Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into the Usage Terms as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such direct rights of enforcement against you.
    6. For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 5.4, to the extent of any inconsistency between the Usage Terms and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms increases the liability of GovTech beyond that stated in Clause 8 (Limitation of Liability).
6. Confidentiality
    1. For the purpose of this Clause, "Confidential Information" means non-public information provided by GovTech to you that is designated as confidential or reasonably should be considered as such, excluding information that:
        1. is or becomes public through no fault on your part;
        2. was known to you before the disclosure;
        3. is disclosed to you by a third party without violation of any confidentiality restrictions; or
        4. is independently developed by the you without access to or use of GovTech’s information.
        
        Confidential Information includes but is not limited to the Services (and any derivatives, performance data, benchmark results, security assessments, Services roadmaps and any other technical information relating to the Services), its derivatives, the terms and conditions of the Agreement and GovTech’s pricing.
    2. You shall:
        1. only use the Confidential Information to exercise your rights and/or to perform your obligations under the Agreement;
        2. use the same degree of care to prevent unauthorized use and disclosure of the Confidential Information as you do for your own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care; and
        3. not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of GovTech. However, with respect to your employees, contractors, or agents, you shall limit access to the Confidential Information only to those employees, contractors, or agents who have a need to access such Confidential Information and who are subject to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those specified in this Clause 6. A disclosure of Confidential Information by such employees, contractors or agents shall be deemed to be a disclosure by you.
    3. You may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by any court, governmental body, or law or regulation, provided that, if legally permissible, you shall provide prompt written notice to GovTech of such disclosure. Upon written request of GovTech, you shall return or destroy, at GovTech’s option, the Confidential Information.
7. Disclaimers, Warranties and Indemnity
    1. The Services are provided on an "as is" and “as available” basis without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, GovTech does not make any representations or warranties of any kind whatsoever in relation to the Services and hereby disclaims all express, implied and/or statutory warranties of any kind to you or any third party, whether arising from usage or custom or trade or by operation of law or otherwise, including but not limited to any representations or warranties:
        1. as to the accuracy, completeness, correctness, currency, timeliness, reliability, availability, interoperability, security, non-infringement, title, merchantability, quality or fitness for any particular purpose of the Services; and/or

    2. GovTech shall also not be liable to you or any third party for any damage or loss of any kind whatsoever and howsoever caused, including but not limited to any direct or indirect, special or consequential damages, loss of income, revenue or profits, lost or damaged data, or damage to your computer, software or any other property, whether arising directly or indirectly from –
        1. your access to or use of this Services, or any part thereof;
        2. any loss of access to our use of this Services or any part of this Services, howsoever caused;
        3. any inaccuracy or incompleteness in, or errors or omissions in the transmission of, the Services;
        4. any delay or interruption in the transmission of the Services, whether caused by delay or interruption in transmission over the internet or otherwise; or
        5. any decision made or action taken by you or any third party in reliance upon the Services,
        
        regardless of whether GovTech has been advised of the possibility of such damage or loss.
    3. Without prejudice and in addition to the foregoing, insofar as the Services facilitate or require the provision, use or functioning of, or is provided in conjunction with, other products, software, materials and/or services not provided by GovTech, GovTech makes no representation or warranty in relation to such products, software, materials and/or services (including without limitation any representation or warranties as to timeliness, reliability, availability, interoperability, quality, fitness for purpose, non-infringement, suitability or accuracy).
    4. You shall not rely on any part of the Services to claim or assert any form of legitimate expectation against GovTech, whether or not arising out of or in connection with GovTech’s roles and functions as a public authority.
    5. You warrant that you have the necessary rights to provide, upload, supply, and/or transmit Your Data to or through the Services and that Your Data does not contain any malicious or unauthorized code, virus, trojan horse, worm, logic bomb or other software routine or hardware components designed to permit unauthorised access, to disable, erase, or otherwise harm software, hardware or data, or to perform any such actions.
    6. You further grant without charge to GovTech a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, licence to use, process, modify, adapt, create derivate works of, reproduce, and sublicense Your Data for all purposes of the Services. 
    7. You agree to indemnify and keep GovTech and its officers, employees, agents and contractors harmless against all liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses (including legal costs on an indemnity basis) howsoever arising out of or in connection with your access or use of the Services (including third party software or services) or your non-compliance with the Usage Terms, Third Party Terms or Incorporated Terms whether or not you had been advised or informed of the nature or extent of such liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses.
8. Limitation of Liability
    1. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, shall GovTech be liable to you for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising out of or in connection with these Usage Terms or out of the use or inability to use the Services or Portal (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other types of damages or losses).
9. General Provisions
    1. These Usage Terms and your rights and liabilities thereunder may not be assigned, delegated or transferred by you without GovTech’s written consent, and any attempt to take such action shall be void and without effect. GovTech may assign, novate, transfer, or sub-contract the rights and liabilities in respect of the Services and the Usage Terms, without notifying you and without further reference to you. Your acceptance of these Usage Terms shall also constitute your consent to such assignment, novation, transfer or sub-contract.
    2. Subject to the rights of the Third Party set out in Clause 5.5, a person who is not a party to the Usage Terms shall have no right under the Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act or otherwise to enforce any of its terms.

    3. GovTech may, at its sole discretion, refer any dispute referred to in Clause 10.2 above to arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) in Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC ("SIAC Rules") for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this Clause.

This right to elect shall not prejudice GovTech’s right to a limitation defence and the period to exercise the right shall not be abridged by reason of any accrual of a limitation defence in favour of GovTech during the said period.
