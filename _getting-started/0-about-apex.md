# What is APEX

APEX (**A**pplication **P**rogramming interface **Ex**change is a self-service API platform developed by GovTech that makes it simple and easy for the agencies to publish, maintain, monitor and secure their APIs. The platform acts as a centralized location to be used by the whole-of-government for producing and consuming APIs promoting data sharing to create innovative digital services.

With APEX, you can

* Expose your business capabilities into lightweight and reusable services to the outside world
* Reduce development effort with an existing pool of reusable APIs.
* Reduce administrative effort to manage an API
* Allow consumer agencies to directly request access to an API using the automated workflow.

APEX meets the data classification requirements for agencies and acts as a bridge for data sharing between the Internet and Intranet zones within the government network.

The underlying technology of APEX is an API Gateway that provides API management capabilities such as API security, traffic monitoring, caching and auditing. An API gateway simplifies data sharing and on boarding of new applications, enabling organizations to collaborate and leverage services efficiently to drive innovation and creativity.
