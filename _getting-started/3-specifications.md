APEX services are charged in terms of APEX Units (AUs). An APEX Unit is the resource used to process the incoming API request and each APEX Unit consists of:

* One CPU
* 4GB RAM

An APEX Unit can typically handle **20** TPS (Transaction Per Second) for REST and **10** TPS for SOAP API calls.

API Calls Per Month:        500,000
Peak Data Size (kB):        50
Average Data Size (kB):     20
Bandwidth Reserve (Mbps):   1

## SOAP API
Peak TPS:                   10
API Calls Per Month:        250,000
Peak Data Size (kB):        100
Average Data Size (kB):     40
